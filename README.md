# Artificial Neural Networks

A self-learning project about creating some Artificial Neural Networks. I believe in great potential of ANNs, so it's final time to learn something about it. For the beginning I am trying to create neural learning by genetic algorithms, probably later I'll just give it reverse tracking, whatever it is. Also, maybe today's structure of NN is just too simplified and we should give it some chaos? Same about neuron.

First milestone - my ANN learned how to differ some arbitrary symbol (in 16 bits) from string of zeroes or ones. Three parameters which I was changing were weights of input signals (-1,0 and 1), threshold and delta (included in equation as exp[(x-d)*t]. I took few random trials to find good start, then one million for genetic algorithms.
