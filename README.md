# Artificial Neural Networks

A self-learning project about creating some Artificial Neural Networks. I believe in great potential of ANNs, so it's final time to learn something about it. For the beginning I am trying to create neural learning by genetic algorithms, probably later I'll just give it reverse tracking, whatever it is. Also, maybe today's structure of NN is just too simplified and we should give it some chaos? Same about neuron.
